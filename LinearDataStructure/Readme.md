## Data Structures Overview
Data structures is a way of storing the data in  a such a way that we can retrieve it efficiently.

**or**

Data structures are ways of organizing data that enable efficient:  
- Storage  
- Retrieval  
- Modification  

	- it is categories into two types:  
    i) non-linear data structure  
    ii) dynamic data structures  

## Linear Data Structures

| Static        | Dynamic         | Characteristics          |
|---------------|-----------------|--------------------------|
| Arrays        | Linked Lists    | Sequential access        |
|               | Stacks          | LIFO principle           |
|               | Queues          | FIFO principle           |

## Non-linear data structure  
- Tree  
- Graphs  

## Static Data structures  
- Static Data structures is a type of Data structures where the size and memory allocation are determined at compile time, and remains fixed throughout the program execution. This means that once structure is created, its size cannot be altered during runtime.  
- You can achieve that with the help of Arrays.
